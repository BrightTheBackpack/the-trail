# The BEEM ⚡️🔦

## **Team Members**
@domvt, @maxdrapa. Made with love in vermont :)

## **Is this our first PCB rodeo?**
dom: "kinda :/"  
max: "I’ve made a bunch of pcbs before, but gave up when I was almost done."  
  
  -**we're excited to give it our best shot!**

## What are we making?
### The BEEM.
The BEEM is a handheld, high-output, and ultra-high-throw light-projection device. Yeah, it's a flashlight, but we think ours will be cooler :)

## Inspiration:
I love my olight, but I wish it had longer throw. Also who doesn't love a good beam? We sure do 😉

## **Sketches**
in progress 👀
