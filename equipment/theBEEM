# The BEEM ⚡️🔦

**Team Members:**
**@domvt, @maxdrapa. Made with love in vermont :)**

**Is this your first PCB rodeo?:**
**dom: "kinda :/", max: "I’ve made a bunch of pcbs before, but gave up when I was almost done"**

**What you are making?**
**The BEEM.**
**The BEEM is a handheld, high-output, and ultra-high-throw light-projection device. It's a flashlight, but cooler."**

**Inspiration:**
**I love my olight, but I wish it had longer throw. Also who doesn't love a good beam? We sure do 😉

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
**IN PROGRESS**
